# Kong Takehome Exercise

I've included a basic Makefile with the basic tasks to make it easier to run commands.

```
$ make help
build                          compile the binary
clean                          clean workspace and remove build/test artifacts
help                           commands help text
run                            launch the server locally
test-unit                      run unit tests
```
